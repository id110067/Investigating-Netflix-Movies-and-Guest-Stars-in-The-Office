# Investigating-Netflix-Movies-and-Guest-Stars-in-The-Office

Netflix! What started in 1997 as a DVD rental service has since exploded into the largest entertainment/media company by market capitalization, boasting over 200 million subscribers as of January 2021.

Given the large number of movies and series available on the platform, it is a perfect opportunity to flex our data manipulation skills and dive into the entertainment industry. Our friend has also been brushing up on their Python skills and has taken a first crack at a CSV file containing Netflix data. For their first order of business, they have been performing some analyses, and they believe that the average duration of movies has been declining.

In this Data Analysis and Visualisation project, we try to extract to data from a csv-file containing information of more than 7500 TV-shows and movies on Netflix. We then analyse, visualise and conclude about various conclusions. We will be working with various Python modules including Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib.

Well, it looks like there is something to the idea that movie lengths have decreased over the past ten years! But equipped only with our friend's aggregations, we're limited in the further explorations we can perform. There are a few questions about this trend that we are currently unable to answer, including:
  a. What does this trend look like over a longer period of time?
  b. Is this explainable by something like the genre of entertainment?
  
As we suspected, non-typical genres such as children's movies and documentaries are all clustered around the bottom half of the plot.
